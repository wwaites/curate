Purpose and Overview
====================

`CKAN`_ is a metadata registry for datasets. These datasets can be
organised into groups for curation purposes. Often these goups have
criteria that must be met in order for datasets to be included. This
tool is intended to help automate checking the metadata to see if a
particular dataset should be included.

The design of this tool is to take a set of rules, expressed in 
`Notation 3`_ and to compare the dataset description against these
rules. The output is an `RDF`_ graph containing statements generated
by the rules. Inclusion in a group depends on contents of this graph. 

An example may make this clearer. Suppose we consider the `LOD
Cloud`_. Inclusion in the cloud means inclusion in the `lodcloud
group`_ on CKAN. Amongst the criteria for inclusion are that a dataset
must contain dereferenceable resources. So we make a simple ruleset::

    @prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
    @prefix void: <http://rdfs.org/ns/void#>.
    @prefix curate: <http://eris.okfn.org/ww/2010/12/curate#>.

    { ?dataset void:exampleResource ?example .
      ?dataset curate:httpGET ?example } =>
    { ?dataset httpGETResult [ 
           resource ?example;
           rdf:value success ]
    }.

This says that if something, the ``?dataset`` has an example resource,
``?example`` and we evaluate the special predicate ``curate:httpGET``
(of which more later) then we can say that the result of the ``GET``
operation was a success. This and other simple rulesets can be found
in the `examples`_ directory in the source distribution.

Indeed the result of using the tool to evaluate the `record for
DBpedia`_ produces a graph that looks like this::

    @prefix ns1: <http://ckan.net/package/>.
    @prefix ns2: <https://github.com/wwaites/curate/raw/master/examples/dereference.n3#>
    @prefix ns4: <http://dbpedia.org/page/>.
    @prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>.

    ns1:dbpedia ns2:httpGETResult
        [ ns2:resource <http://dbpedia.org/data/DBpedia.rdf>;
          rdf:value ns2:success],
        [ ns2:resource ns4:DBpedia;
          rdf:value ns2:success],
        [ ns2:resource <http://dbpedia.org/data/DBpedia.n3>;
          rdf:value ns2:success].

The command line used to do this was:

.. code-block:: sh

    curate -v \
        -r https://github.com/wwaites/curate/raw/master/examples/dereference.n3 \
        dbpedia
