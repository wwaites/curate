Built-in Predicates
===================

Built-in predicates are the what makes this tool work. They are the
glue between the inference rules and the operational python code that
does the actual checking. The current list of built-ins together with
their documentations is reproduced below.

For the general idea of how to use built-ins see the purpose and
overview section which has some examples. 

If you are a programmer wishing to implement a new builtin, see the 
`implementing`_ section below

.. autofunction:: curate.builtins.cmpURI

.. _implementing:

Implementing New Built-ins
--------------------------

Suppose we wanted to implement a new builtin that would pass or fail
half the time. Let's call it ``coinToss``.

.. code-block:: python

    from random import choice

    def coinToss(pats, pato):
        """
	The built in function gets called when it occurs in the
	left hand side of a rule, the pattern to match. it is a
	predicate, and it gets passed the values of subject and
	object. It must return a function that will be called for
	bound variables whenever the pattern matches.
	"""
        def f(subject, object):
	    """
	    This function gets called on bound variables and does
	    the actual work. It must return either True or False.
	    In this case we do not actually care about the subject
	    or object that have been passed in but a real builtin
	    would.
	    """
	    return choice([True, False])
	return f

The :program:`curate` tool will look in the list of package
entrypoints for ones in a section called ``curate.builtins``. So to
make this built-in predicate useable we have to put something like
this the part of our call to :func:`setup` in our ``setup.py`` 
that deals with entrypoints.

.. code-block:: python

    setup(...
        entry_points="""
            [curate.builtins]
            coinToss=example.package:coinToss
        """
    )

Once the package is installed this builtin will be useable in N3
rules as in, for example::

    @prefix curate: <http://eris.okfn.org/ww/2010/12/curate#>.

    { ?foo curate:coinToss ?bar } => { ?foo flipped true }
